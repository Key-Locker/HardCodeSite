Welcome to the not brief explanation of the storyline! I am happy you clicked because this is where it gets good.

The game is set in a dystopian, corrupt, cyberpunk rundown world. Programming is strictly illegal, enough to be sentenced to death. You begin the game in outer space just after you've been teleported to a giant spaceship; stars are in the background. You enter the spaceship and are told there are lots of opportunities for money if you're willing to take the challenge (if you choose "No," the game ends). She does not tell you anything about programming being a death sentence, she is greedy and wants her cut from however much you make and doesn't care what happens to you, but it's for a more significant cause you are told laterâ€¦ She allows you to choose your language on your Abacus (what you will be programming on), a little bit of money to get yourself started, and sets you off. "Do not get into debt, and do not lend anyone money. You do not want to owe anyone anything, nor have them owe you," she says.
                    
You get teleported to a rundown area outside the Main City at nighttime. You begin looking around for anyone and find a place with their lights on; inside is someone in the same position as you but less fortunate. They were sent down by the boss and have been waiting for days inside this house for any of her men. Finally, the person in the house decides to leave, becoming overly frustrated at your boss for leaving her stranded. Almost as soon as they go, one of your boss' men comes from a secret entrance and begins speaking to you and gives you a tutorial, a brief rundown of the city (still not telling you about programming being illegal). He shows you where to put your money for safety because if you're outside at night, people may rob you of whatever you have.
                    
You begin taking jobs, unknowing of the risks. Your boss also emails you that she needs you to crack codes. These codes become progressively more difficult. These messages are usually financial statements in trillions of dollars. After a while, one of these messages that you crack says, "Go to {certain place} at {certain time}, tell no one," you, of course, oblige. When you go, you are greeted by this anxious, fast-talking girl there. She tells you to hush and starts talking to herself, wondering why she's telling you what she is about to do. She begins by saying that an illegal organization has hired you. She says that programming is a death sentence here; no one is allowed to do or learn about programming. Your boss is using you for the cut she is taking on your sales; she doesn't care if you die. This girl continues and starts telling you what your boss does and why. She says your boss sends people here to undercut the giants that own a monopoly on software. These few people became so wealthy from their programs that they decided to band together and take over the government. They used the vast wealth they've gained from their software to become the only people allowed to create software, and each has their own role/specialty (game, math, data), so they don't step on each other's toes. They are evil aristocrats that will do anything, including murder, to prevent others from gaining wealth as they have. She says for now, you're not making much money, so they will not notice, but at some point, they will begin to investigate. She tells you to only program in safe places or at night; you do not want to be caught here.
                    
You continue getting contracts and undercutting the rich. Your boss notices you've been acting odd and sends an email: "I've seen how you've been moving around the city. Someone has told you about the legalities, or lack thereof, of programming. I did not initially tell you because I didn't want you to feel unsafe, therefore, less likely to accept the job. It was a very selfish and uncaring thing for me to do, but you must understand that it is for the greater good. I need money to execute my plan to take over the government, ending this aristocracy. I would like you to be a part of my plan. I can tell that you are a good programmer and willing to learn. For now, keep doing what you're doing, and I will update you when I know the correct move for you."
                    
She emails you back one day with a plan, she is going to smuggle you into one of the other cities, and you will begin undercutting there as well. You will try to meet up with her other men, and they will tell you more about the plan in person. She does not want to email you with any information because she doesn't know who may be watching or reading. 

The plan to get smuggled is executed well, and you're in the city. You meet up with her men, who begin telling you how this city runs vs. the Main City. You can already tell that this city is much nicer, much cleaner. The people are dressed better. Your boss' men tell you about the plan; they say that there are these items each aristocrat possesses. When you defeat an aristocrat, the item is hard coded to swap possession to the victor of the battle, the better programmer. You must keep your identity secret because people will come to murder you once they know you have one of these items. They are priceless but cannot function unless palmed by the victor. We have yet to be told the specifics of their power, but it will be revealed when we are closer to achieving this goal. They tell you to continue doing what you were doing in the Main City, continue programming and undercutting, and be careful. Do not get caught in this city.
                    
After some time of doing as you were told, progressing, and making money, you get spotted by a guard, except in this town, the guards are less corrupt and less likely to be paid off. You get taken to a jail cell where you're taunted about your imminent fate by the guards until a well-dressed man comes in and begins yelling at them, to which they apologize to the man and backpedal. He says that he sees your skill and is willing to take you in as a pupil. He tells them to release you from jail and for you to follow him. You make it back to his huge apartment and learn that this man is very high up in the government, close to the aristocrat of this city. He tells you that the aristocrat maintains a small number of programmers. Sometimes the aristocrat is too busy to complete all of the smaller, less challenging programming jobs (and there are many of them). He says you will either be hired for them or sentenced to death. There is no choice; you take the job. He asks how much you were getting paid, cuts you off before you can respond and jokes that he already knows, then tells you that it's chump change in comparison. He says that your boss, by now, knows of your capture and that all of her information was released to the public. He starts making fun of her death, saying that a life like that is a life of a roach, scavenging. He says all the people in the Main City are cockroaches, worthless lives.
                    
You begin working for this evil man. You notice how much more money you make while working under the "government," continuing to do the same jobs. You get stopped one day and told in whispers to meet at {specific place} at {particular time} once again. When you get there, they begin giving you the plan to take over the government and a way to get to the aristocrat of that city. They tell you to continue doing what you're doing for now, gain and keep their trust above all. You are informed that your old boss is safe; she was under an alias the entire time. They could never find her, nor will you be able to now. She is in hiding. They say that you are famous in the main city, being able to make it out alive.. Or infamous is the better word now that you're working for the bad guys. You leave that meeting and continue enjoying your life of luxury.
                    
ALRIGHTY THEN, I still need to figure out a good way to get to the bosses and how you'll be introduced to the other cities. Thank you for reading for now:)
