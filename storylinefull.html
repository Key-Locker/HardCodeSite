The game is set in a futuresc dystopian corrupt cyberpunk run down world. Programming in this world is strictly illegal, enough to be sentenced to death. You begin the game in outer space, just after you’ve been teleported to a large spaceship. Stars in the background. You enter the spaceship and are told that there is a lot of opportunity for money, if you’re willing to take the challenge (if you choose no the game ends). She does not tell you anything about programming being a death sentence, she is greedy and wants her cut of however much you make and doesn’t care what happens to you, or so you figure out.. She gives you your abacus (what you will be programming on), a little bit of money to get yourself settled, and sets you off. “Do not get into debt, and do not lend anyone money. You do not want to owe anyone anything, nor have them owe you” she says.
                    
You get teleported to a very run down area of the Main City, it’s night time. You begin looking around for anyone and find a place with their lights on, they see that you’re new in town and offer for you to stay the night. You wake up and all of your money has been stolen, but they did not find your abacus. This is the type of city you’re in, you cannot trust anyone, which is very earlyon conveyed. Once you wake up and walk around one of your bosses men spots you, dusts you off while laughing, and gives you a brief rundown of the city (still not telling you about programming being illegal). He shows you where to put your money for safety, because if you’re outside at night, people may rob you of whatever you have.
                    
You begin taking jobs, unknowing of the risks. Your boss sends you messages that she needs you to crack, which become progressively more difficult. These messages are usually financial statements, in the trillions of dollars. After a while, one of these messages that you crack says “Go to {certain place} at {certain time}, tell no one”, you of course oblige. When you go, you are greeted by this anxious, fast talking girl there. She tells you to hush and starts talking to herself, begins wondering why she’s telling you what she is about to. She begins by saying that you’ve been hired by an illegal organization. She says that programming is a death sentence here, no one is allowed to do or learn about programming. Your boss is using you for the cut she is taking on your sales, she doesn’t care if you die. This girl continues, starts telling you about what your boss does and why. She says that your boss sends people here to undercut the giants that own a monopoly on software. These few people became so rich off of their programs, they decided to band together and take over the government. They used their vast wealth they’ve gained from their software to become the only people allowed to create software, and they each have their own role/specialty (game, math, data) so they don’t step on eachother's feet. They are evil aristocrats that will do anything including murder to prevent others from gaining wealth as they have. She says for now, you’re not making much money so they will not notice, but at some point they will, and they will begin to investigate. She tells you to only program in safe places or at night, you do not want to be caught here.
                    
You continue getting contracts, and undercutting the rich. Your boss notices how you’ve been acting and sends an email saying: I’ve noticed the way you’ve been moving around the city. Someone has told you information about the legalities, or lack thereof, for programming. I did not originally tell you because I didn’t want you to feel unsafe, therefore less likely to accept the job. It was a very selfish and uncaring thing for me to do, but you must understand that it is for the greater good. I need money to execute my plan to take over the government, ending this aristocracy. I would like you to be a part of my plan. I can tell that you are a good programmer, and that you are willing to learn. For now, keep doing what you’re doing and I will give you updates when I know the correct move for you. 
                    
She emails you back one day with a plan, she is going to smuggle you into one of the other cities and you will begin undercutting there for now. You will try to meet up with her other men, and they will tell you more about the plan in person. She does not want to email you with any information because she doesn’t know who may be watching. The plan to get smuggled is executed well, and you’re in the city. You meet up with her men and they begin telling you about how this city runs vs the Main City. You can already tell that this city is much nicer, much cleaner. The people are dressed better. Your bosses' men tell you about the plan, they say that there are these items each aristocrat possesses. When you defeat an aristocrat, the item is hard coded to swap possession to the victor of the battle, the better programmer. You must keep your identity secret, because people will come to murder you once they know you have one of these items. They are priceless, but cannot function unless palmed by the victor. We have yet to be told the specifics of their power, but when we are closer to achieving this goal it will be revealed. They tell you to continue doing what you were doing in the Main City, continue programming and undercutting, being careful. Do not get caught in this city.
                    
After some time of doing as you were told, progressing and making money, you get spotted by a guard, except in this town, the guards are less corrupt, and less likely to be paid off. You get taken to a jail cell where you’re taunted about your imminent fate by the guards, until a well dressed man comes in and begins yelling at them to which they apologize to the man and backpedal. He says that he sees the skill you have, and that he is willing to take you in as a pupil. He tells them to release you from jail, and for you to follow him. You make it back to his huge apartment and learn that this man is very high up in the government, close with the aristocrat of this city. He tells you that there is a small number of programmers that the aristocrat maintains. Sometimes the aristocrat is too busy to complete all of the smaller, less challenging programming jobs (and there are a lot of them). He says that you will either be hired for them, or sentenced to death. There is no choice, you take the job. He asks how much you were getting paid, cuts you off before you can respond andjokes that he already knows, then tells you that it’s chump change in comparison. He says that your boss by now knows of your capture, and that all of her information was released to the public. He starts making fun of her death, saying that a life like that is a life of a roach, scavenging. All of the people in the Main City are cockroaches, worthless lives, he says.
                    
You begin working for this evil man. You notice how much more money you make while working under the “government”, continuing along doing the same type of  jobs. You get stopped one day and told in whispers to meet at {certain place} at {certain time} once again. When you get there, they begin giving you the plan to take over the government and a way to get to the aristocrat of that city. They tell you to continue doing what you’re doing for now, gain and keep their trust above all. You are informed that your old boss is safe, she was under an alias the entire time. They could never find her, nor will you be able to now. She is in hiding. They say that you are famous in the main city, being able to make it out alive.. Or maybe infamous is the better word now that you’re working for the bad guys. You leave that meeting, and continue on enjoying your life of luxury.
                    
ALRIGHTY THEN I still need to figure out a good way to get to the bosses and how you’ll be introduced to the other cities. Thank you for reading for now:)
